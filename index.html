                <p> Few things authentically capture crypto like the term "Animal Spirits". How many of CTs elite present themselves as animals rather than people? There's a quote that gets tossed around my discord every week or so that goes,
                </p>
                <p>
                "im not sure why, but when the markets are in an uptrend, i get very euphoric. I cant sit straight in my chair, my heart is beating fast and I cant think rationally"

But as I spent more time refining my follows on Twitter I noticed a ton of them were "animals." Went I think of CL207 or Boffin, I don't think of people. I imagine their PFPs and started to question if that's how myths are made. Anyway, here are some pixel renditions of things that terrify people living in the Appalachians.

                        <p>Whispers among the old lumberjacks spun a tale of the Hodag as a beast of formidable strength, with a penchant for mischief and malice, feasting not only on the flesh of unfortunate animals but also, it is said, on the pure fear of those who encounter it. The air around it is thick with the scent of pine and the unspoken dread of those who tread too close to its lair.</p>

                        <p>The jackalope is a mythical animal of North American folklore described as a jackrabbit with antelope horns.

                        <p>Legend tells that on rare, hushed evenings, the Frogman emerges from his aquatic lair, perhaps once a prince or a guardian of ancient, sunken treasures, now bound to the riverbanks of Loveland.

                        <p>The Howler, as the name suggests, is notorious for its spine-chilling cry—a sound that combines the howl of a wolf, the wail of a human in distress, and the growl of a rabid dog.

                <p> Do  you even know the lore? There is so much to unpack about CT your first temptation is likely to ignore it, but you can't because then you won't know who to follow and who to avoid. Over time, you see the same names being mentioned in awe or disgust and eventually you build up a mental image of a stranger who you can only visualize as a fox or a frog. And that, I'm assuming, is how legends are born.
